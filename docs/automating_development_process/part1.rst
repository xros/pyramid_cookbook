What is pyramid_starter_seed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This tutorial should help you to start developing with the Pyramid web 
framework using a very minimal starter seed project based on:

- a Pyramid's `pcreate -t starter` project
- a `Yeoman <http://yeoman.io>`_ `generator-webapp` project

You can find the Pyramid starter seed code here on Github:

- `pyramid_starter_seed <https://github.com/davidemoro/pyramid_starter_seed>`_

Thanks to Yeoman you can improve your developer experience when you are in 
**development** or **production** mode thanks to:

- Javascript testing setup
- Javascript code linting
- Javascript/CSS concat and minification
- image assets optimization
- html template minification
- switch to CDN versions of you vendor plugins in production mode
- uncss
- much more (you can add features adding new Grunt tasks)

We will see later how you can clone `pyramid_starter_seed` from github, add 
new features (eg: authentication, SQLAlchemy support, user models, a json 
REST API, add a modern Javascript framework as AngularJS, etc) and then 
launch a console script that helps you to rename the entire project with 
your more opinionated modifications, for example 
`pyramid_yourawesomeproduct`.
